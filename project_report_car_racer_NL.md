**Introduction**

&#x20;This is a computer car racing game (Car Racer) which can be playing by many users. Racing track has some obstacles that need to avoid. I used LLM to define the requirements stp by step and write the python basic code for each steps. Then I modified the code to acheive my requirements.

**Description of the game:**

 Car Racer is a simple racing game where players control a car using keyboard inputs and navigate through predefine track  while avoiding obstacles and collecting points. Car images can be created separately and import to the game.

**Improvement ideas:**

&#x20;·        If it hits a obstacles speed will be reduce by half

·        When the cars are very close (need to define the distance) , back car can get speed boost by 1.5 times if DRS Zone is defined.

·        If car overtakes by cutting the path’s out line, it have to give the position back.

·        If car cuts the path more than 3 times, it reduces the speed by half.

·        Add many cars on the race.

·        Can can crash maximum three times before complete the track.

·        Number of track rounds can be defined by the racer before start the game# TODO: Write project report here
