After you have chosen a topic, create a brief software requirements specification (SRS) document for the project. The SRS document should contain at least the following sections:

- Introduction (with purpose and scope)
- Overall description (with product perspective, product functions, and user characteristics)
- Specific requirements

**Introduction**

This is a computer car racing game (Car Racer) which can be playing by many users. Racing track has some obstacles that need to avoid. 

Description of the game:

Car Racer is a simple racing game where players control a car using keyboard inputs and navigate through predefine track  while avoiding obstacles and collecting points. Car images can be created separately and import to the game.


Here's a basic outline of how the game can be coded using Python: 

1\. Set up the game window and import necessary libraries (e.g., Pygame). 

2\. Create a car object and set its initial position on the screen. 

3\. Create a track with different obstacles and points using rectangles or images.

` `4. Implement keyboard controls to move the car left or right.

` `5. Add collision detection to check if the car hits any obstacles or collects points. 

6\. Keep track of the player's score and display it on the screen. 

7\. Add a timer to measure the player's time to complete the track. 

8\. Implement game over conditions, such as running out of time or hitting too many obstacles. 

9\. Display a game over screen with the final score and an option to restart the game. 

10\. Add sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience. 

This is a basic framework for the game,


**Improvement ideas:**

- If it hits a obstacles speed will be reduce by half
- When the cars are very close , back car can get speed boost if DRS Zone is define.
- If car overtakes by cutting the path, it has to give the position back
- If car cuts the path more than 3 times, it reduce the speed by half
- Add many cars on the race

 


Python libraries like Pygame make it relatively easy to create 2D games involving cars. With a little creativity and coding, you can bring the Car Racer game to life!


import pygame 

import random 

\# Step 1: Set up the game window and import necessary libraries 

pygame.init() 

window\_width = 800 

window\_height = 600 

game\_window = pygame.display.set\_mode((window\_width, window\_height))

pygame.display.set\_caption("Car Game")

\# Step 2: Create a car object and set its initial position on the screen 

car\_image = pygame.image.load("car.png") 

car\_width = 50 

car\_height = 100 

car\_x = window\_width // 2 - car\_width // 2 

car\_y = window\_height - car\_height - 10 

car\_speed = 5


\# Step 3: Create a track with different obstacles and points 

obstacle\_width = 50 

obstacle\_height = 50 

obstacle\_x = random.randint(0, window\_width - obstacle\_width) 

obstacle\_y = -obstacle\_height 

obstacle\_speed = 3

point\_width = 30 

point\_height = 30 

point\_x = random.randint(0, window\_width - point\_width) 

point\_y = -point\_height 

point\_speed = 2

\# Step 4: Implement keyboard controls to move the car left or right 

def move\_car(direction): 

if direction == "left": 

car\_x -= car\_speed 

elif direction == "right":

car\_x += car\_speed

\# Step 5: Add collision detection to check if the car hits any obstacles or collects points 

def check\_collision(): 

global car\_x, car\_y, obstacle\_x, obstacle\_y, point\_x, point\_y obstacle\_rect = pygame.Rect(obstacle\_x, obstacle\_y, obstacle\_width, obstacle\_height) 

point\_rect = pygame.Rect(point\_x, point\_y, point\_width, point\_height) car\_rect = pygame.Rect(car\_x, car\_y, car\_width, car\_height) 

if car\_rect.colliderect(obstacle\_rect): 

return "obstacle" 

elif car\_rect.colliderect(point\_rect): 

return "point" 

else:

return None

\# Step 6: Keep track of the player's score and display it on the screen 

score = 0 

font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36) 

\# Step 7: Add a timer to measure the player's time to complete the track 

clock = pygame.time.Clock() 

start\_time = pygame.time.get\_ticks() 

time\_limit = 60000 # 60 seconds

\# Step 8: Implement game over conditions 

game\_over = False 

\# Step 10: Add sound effects and background music

pygame.mixer.music.load("background\_music.mp3")

pygame.mixer.music.play(-1) # -1 means play the music on loop 

collision\_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("collision\_sound.wav") 

point\_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("point\_sound.wav")

while not game\_over: 

for event in pygame.event.get(): 

if event.type == pygame.QUIT:

game\_over = True 

elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN: 

if event.key == pygame.K\_LEFT:

move\_car("left") 

elif event.key == pygame.K\_RIGHT:

` `move\_car("right")

` `game\_window.fill((255, 255, 255)) 

\# Move obstacles and points 

obstacle\_y += obstacle\_speed 

point\_y += point\_speed 

\# Check if the car hits any obstacles or collects points

collision\_result = check\_collision()

if collision\_result == "obstacle": 

game\_over = True 

elif collision\_result == "point": 

score += 1 

point\_x = random.randint(0, window\_width - point\_width)

point\_y = -point\_height 

\# Draw car, obstacles, and points on the screen

game\_window.blit(car\_image, (car\_x, car\_y))

pygame.draw.rect(game\_window, (255, 0, 0), (obstacle\_x, obstacle\_y, obstacle\_width, obstacle\_height))

pygame.draw.rect(game\_window, (0, 255, 0), (point\_x, point\_y, point\_width, point\_height)) 

\# Display score on the screen 

score\_text = font.render("Score: " + str(score), True, (0, 0, 0))

` `game\_window.blit(score\_text, (10, 10)) 

\# Display timer on the screen 

elapsed\_time = pygame.time.get\_ticks() - start\_time 

remaining\_time = max(0, time\_limit - elapsed\_time) 

timer\_text = font.render("Time: " + str(remaining\_time // 1000), True, (0, 0, 0)) 

game\_window.blit(timer\_text, (window\_width - 100, 10)) 

\# Check game over conditions 

if remaining\_time <= 0:

game\_over = True 

pygame.display.update() 

clock.tick(60)

\# Step 9: Display a game over screen with the final score and an option to restart the game 

game\_over\_text = font.render("Game Over", True, (0, 0, 0)) 

score\_text = font.render("Final Score: " + str(score), True, (0, 0, 0)) 

restart\_text = font.render("Press R to Restart", True, (0, 0, 0)) 

while True: 

game\_window.fill((255, 255, 255))

game\_window.blit(game\_over\_text, (window\_width // 2 - 100, window\_height // 2 - 50)) 

game\_window.blit(score\_text, (window\_width // 2 - 100, window\_height // 2)) 

game\_window.blit(restart\_text, (window\_width // 2 - 120, window\_height // 2 + 50)) 

pygame.display.update() 

for event in pygame.event.get(): 

if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN: 

if event.key == pygame.K\_r: 

\# Restart the game 

car\_x = window\_width // 2 - car\_width // 2

car\_y = window\_height - car\_height – 10

obstacle\_x = random.randint(0, window\_width - obstacle\_width) 

obstacle\_y = -obstacle\_height 

point\_x = random.randint(0, window\_width - point\_width) 

point\_y = -point\_height 

score = 0 

start\_time = pygame.time.get\_ticks()

` `game\_over = False

pygame.mixer.music.play(-1) 

\# Restart the background music 

break

Make sure to replace the file names `"car.png"`, `"background\_music.mp3"`, `"collision\_sound.wav"`, and `"point\_sound.wav"` with the appropriate file names for your game.
